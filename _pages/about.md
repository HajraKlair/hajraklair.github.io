Welcome to Hajra's webpage! 
I'm a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech, working in the Digital Libraries Research Group with Bill Ingram from University Libraries and Dr. Hoda Eldardiry from the Machine Learning Lab. My research sits at the intersection of digital libraries and information retrieval.
Before starting my Ph.D., I spent several years teaching undergraduate computing courses. I've taught Programming, Database Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Information Processing. I completed my Master's in Computer Science Engineering at Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2016.
